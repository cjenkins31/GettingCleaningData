# Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project

## Overview ##

The run_analysis.R script demonstrates the process of creating a tidy set from a collection of data.  A full description of the data can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository][1]

The source data can be found [here][2].

## Script Summary ##

The following steps will be performed:

 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names. 
 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Note: If you are running this script on your computer, be sure to change the working directory to where you have unzipped the source data

## Additional Info ##
Please see the CodeBook.MD file for additional information about the data, variables, and transformations.
